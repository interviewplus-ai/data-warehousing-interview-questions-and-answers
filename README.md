## 1. What is Data Warehousing?

Data Warehousing is the process of collecting, storing, and managing data from various sources to support business intelligence and decision-making processes.

## 2. What are the key components of a Data Warehouse?

The key components of a Data Warehouse are:

- Data Sources
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Process
- Data Storage
- Metadata
- Business Intelligence Tools

## 3.  How does ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process work in Data Warehousing?

The ETL process involves extracting data from multiple sources, transforming it to a consistent format, and loading it into the Data Warehouse. This process ensures data quality, consistency, and compatibility for analysis and reporting.

## 4. What is the difference between OLTP and OLAP databases?

OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) databases are optimized for transactional processing, while OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) databases are designed for complex analytics and reporting. OLTP databases focus on transactional efficiency, whereas OLAP databases prioritize query performance and data aggregation.

## 5. What is a Star Schema in Data Warehousing?

A Star Schema is a dimensional model in Data Warehousing that organizes data into a central fact table surrounded by dimension tables. The fact table contains numerical measures, while dimension tables provide descriptive attributes for analysis and reporting.

## 6. What is the purpose of Aggregates in Data Warehousing?

Aggregates are precalculated summaries of data in a Data Warehouse. They improve query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed. Aggregates are especially useful for complex analytical queries that involve large datasets.

## 7. How does Data Warehousing facilitate data integration?

Data Warehousing facilitates data integration by consolidating data from multiple sources into a unified and consistent format. It allows organizations to combine data from different systems, databases, or even external sources to create a comprehensive view for analysis and reporting.

## 8. What is Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) in Data Warehousing?

Slowly Changing Dimension refers to the process of managing changes to dimension data over time in a Data Warehouse. It helps track historical data and enables analysis of how data has changed over different periods, such as capturing changes in customer attributes or product details.

## 9. What are Data Marts in Data Warehousing?

Data Marts are subsets of a Data Warehouse that focus on specific business areas or departments. They contain summarized and tailored data for a particular domain, making it easier for users to access and analyze information relevant to their needs.

## 10. What is the role of Dimensional Modeling in Data Warehousing?

Dimensional Modeling is a technique used to design the structure of a Data Warehouse. It involves identifying and organizing business dimensions, fact tables, and hierarchies to optimize query performance and facilitate easy data analysis.

## 11. What are the advantages of using a Data Warehouse?

The advantages of using a Data Warehouse include:

- Centralized and unified view of data.
- Improved data quality and consistency.
- Enhanced decision-making through advanced analytics.
- Scalability to handle large volumes of data.
- Historical data analysis for trend identification.

## 12. How does Data Warehousing support business intelligence and reporting?

Data Warehousing supports business intelligence and reporting by providing a consolidated and integrated view of data from various sources. It enables organizations to perform complex analytics, generate meaningful insights, and create reports and dashboards for data-driven decision-making.
